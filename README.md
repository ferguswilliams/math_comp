## This repository contains a selection of mathematical coding projects completed at University.
## Project 1: mathematical_modelling_project.py
### This project has looked to solve and analyse solutions of a one and two species population model. The script creates a root finder for the model's differential equations using the Newton Raphson method. Functions are defined to solve the differential equations using the Runge-Kutta-4 method. Phase space plots are generated for the two competing species model.
## Project 2: multivariate_calc1.py, multiariate_calc2.py
### multivariate_calc1.py analyses the accuracy of the forward difference and centred difference methods as an approximation to a functions (partial) derivative.
### multivariate_calc2.py numerically integrates 1 and 2D functions using the Trapezium rule. The order of accuracy of the method is determined to be 2.
